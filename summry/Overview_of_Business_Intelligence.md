##  Chapter 1 - An Overview of Business Intelligence
This lecture introduces the field of Business Intelligence (BI), analytics, and decision support. It explains *why* modern organizations need these tools and provides a conceptual foundation for the rest of the course.


## The Core Concept: Pressures, Responses, and Support

The central idea is that the business environment today is turbulent and highly complex. This creates a constant stream of "pressures" and "opportunities" for organizations.

This is broken down into a three-part model:

1.  **Business Environmental Factors:** These are the *pressures* forcing companies to change. They include globalization, market conditions, competition, and government regulations.
2.  **Organization's Responses:** These are the *actions* companies must take to survive and succeed, such as developing new strategies, improving productivity, collaborating with partners, and enabling real-time responses.
3.  **Decisions and Support:** To make these responses effective, managers need a support system. This is where BI comes in, providing the **analyses, predictions, and decisions** that guide the organization's actions.


## A Deeper Look at Business Pressures

The lecture identifies four major categories of pressures:

* **Markets:** Strong competition, expanding global markets, and the rise of electronic markets on the internet.
* **Consumer Demands:** Customers are more powerful and less loyal. They desire customization, high quality, and speed.
* **Technology:** Rapid innovation, an increasing rate of obsolescence, "information overload," and the rise of social networking.
* **Societal:** Increased government regulations, concerns about security, a focus on social responsibility, and the need for sustainability.


## Organizational Responses and Closing the Strategy Gap

In response to these pressures, managers must be proactive and adaptive. They use actions like strategic planning, improving customer service, and, most importantly, **improving decision-making by employing analytics**.

The primary objective of this computerized support (BI) is to facilitate **"closing the strategy gap"**—the difference between the organization's *current performance* and its *desired performance* (its mission and goals).


## Managerial Decision Making

Management is defined as the process of achieving goals using resources, which essentially makes **management synonymous with decision-making**.

To understand this, the lecture introduces **Mintzberg's 10 Managerial Roles**, which are grouped into three categories:
1.  **Interpersonal:** (e.g., Figurehead, Leader)
2.  **Informational:** (e.g., Monitor, Spokesperson)
3.  **Decisional:** (e.g., Entrepreneur, Disturbance Handler, Resource Allocator)

To perform these roles, managers need timely information and tools to support and improve their decision-making. This is typically done through a four-step process: defining the problem, constructing a model, identifying and evaluating solutions, and finally choosing a solution.


## The Gory & Scott-Morten Decision Support Framework

This is a foundational framework that helps us understand *where* computerized support is most needed. It classifies decisions along two axes:

1.  **Type of Control (Anthony, 1965):**
    * **Strategic Planning:** Top-level, long-range decisions.
    * **Management Control:** Tactical, mid-level planning.
    * **Operational Control:** Day-to-day decisions.

2.  **Degree of Structuredness (Simon, 1977):**
    * **Structured:** Repetitive and routine decisions with a clear, programmed solution (e.g., order entry, accounts payable). These are easy to automate.
    * **Unstructured:** Complex problems with no clear-cut solution, requiring human judgment (e.g., R&D planning, new product planning).
    * **Semi-structured:** A mix of both. These problems have some structured elements but also require human judgment (e.g., budget analysis, project scheduling, credit evaluation).

**The key takeaway is that Decision Support Systems (DSS) and BI are most valuable in supporting semi-structured and unstructured decisions.**


## From DSS to Business Intelligence (BI)

**Decision Support Systems (DSS)** were defined in the 1970s as interactive computer-based systems that help decision-makers use data and models to solve unstructured problems.

**Business Intelligence (BI) is an evolution of these DSS concepts.**

* **Definition:** BI is an **"umbrella term"** that combines architectures, tools, databases, analytical tools, applications, and methodologies.
* **Main Objective:** To enable interactive, real-time access to data (and models) to give business managers the ability to conduct analysis.
* **The Goal:** BI helps transform **Data ➡️ Information ➡️ Decisions ➡️ Action**.


## The History and Architecture of BI

### A Brief History
* **1970s:** MIS reporting (static, periodic reports).
* **1980s:** Executive Information Systems (EIS).
* **1990s:** The rise of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), ad-hoc reporting, and trend analysis. The term "BI" was coined by the Gartner Group.
* **2010s:** BI expanded to include AI, data mining, web-based portals, Big Data, and social media analytics.

### The Four Major Components of BI Architecture
1.  **The Data Warehouse (DW):** The foundation, holding the source data.
2.  **Business Analytics (BA):** A collection of tools for manipulating, mining, and analyzing the data in the DW.
3.  **Business Performance Management (BPM):** Tools for monitoring and analyzing performance (e.g., scorecards and dashboards).
4.  **The User Interface (UI):** The system that users interact with (e.g., a dashboard).


## The Taxonomy of Analytics

The lecture concludes by classifying analytics into three types:

1.  **Descriptive Analytics:** Answers "What happened?" (e.g., reports, dashboards).
2.  **Predictive Analytics:** Answers "What will happen?" (e.g., forecasting, data mining).
3.  **Prescriptive Analytics:** Answers "What should we do?" (e.g., optimization, simulation, decision models).

Finally, the lecture presents several **Application Cases** (e.g., Sabre, Seattle Children's Hospital, *Moneyball*, ICBC, Nationwide Insurance) to show how these concepts are used in the real world to solve business problems.
