# Chapter 4 – Business Reporting, Visual Analytics, and BPM

This chapter focuses on how organizations use **business reporting, dashboards, visualization, and performance management**
to monitor performance, support decisions, and align operations with strategy.

---

## 1. Business Reporting

### 1.1 What is a Business Report?

A **business report** is a structured communication artifact designed to:
- Present information clearly
- Support managerial decision making
- Monitor performance and activities

Reports transform **data into information** that managers can understand and act upon.

---

### 1.2 Key Characteristics of Effective Reports

Successful business reports emphasize:
- **Brevity** – concise and focused
- **Clarity** – easy to read and interpret
- **Completeness** – sufficient information for decisions
- **Correctness** – accurate and reliable data

---

### 1.3 Types of Business Reports

Common report categories include:
- **Routine reports:** scheduled, periodic
- **Ad hoc reports:** created on demand
- **Exception reports:** highlight deviations
- **Drill-down reports:** provide increasing detail
- **Metric management reports:** focus on KPIs and SLAs
- **Dashboards:** visual summaries of performance

---

## 2. Business Reporting Systems

A business reporting system consists of:
- **Data sources** (DW, data marts)
- **Business logic** (calculations, KPIs)
- **Presentation layer** (reports, dashboards)
- **Distribution mechanisms** (web, email, portals)

Its goal is to ensure consistent and timely delivery of information.

---

## 3. Dashboards

### 3.1 What is a Dashboard?

A **dashboard** is a visual display that presents **key performance indicators (KPIs)** on a **single screen**,
allowing managers to quickly assess organizational performance.

---

### 3.2 Dashboard Design Principles

Effective dashboards:
- Display the most important metrics only
- Fit on one screen without scrolling
- Use visual cues (color, position, size)
- Enable comparison against targets
- Support quick interpretation without training

---

### 3.3 Types of Dashboards

- **Strategic dashboards:** long-term goals, executives
- **Tactical dashboards:** departmental monitoring
- **Operational dashboards:** real-time or near real-time operations

---

## 4. Information Visualization

### 4.1 Information Visualization vs Data Visualization

- **Data visualization:** shows raw or aggregated data
- **Information visualization:** adds context, relationships, and meaning

Visualization helps users:
- Detect patterns
- Identify trends
- Recognize outliers

---

### 4.2 Common Visualization Techniques

- Bar charts
- Line charts
- Scatter plots
- Heat maps
- Tree maps
- Geographic maps

Choosing the correct chart is essential for accurate interpretation.

---

## 5. Visual Analytics

**Visual analytics** combines:
- Information visualization
- Analytical reasoning
- Predictive analytics

Its purpose is to support **sense-making** in complex and large datasets,
where automated analysis alone is insufficient.

---

## 6. Business Performance Management (BPM)

### 6.1 What is BPM?

**Business Performance Management (BPM)**—also known as **Corporate Performance Management (CPM)**—
is a set of processes and methodologies used to:
- Monitor performance
- Manage strategy execution
- Align operational activities with organizational goals

---

### 6.2 Closed-Loop BPM Process

BPM follows a **closed-loop cycle**:
1. **Strategize** – define goals and objectives
2. **Plan** – translate strategy into operational plans
3. **Monitor & Analyze** – track performance using KPIs
4. **Act & Adjust** – take corrective actions

This loop ensures continuous performance improvement.

---

## 7. Balanced Scorecard (BSC)

The **Balanced Scorecard** provides a multidimensional view of performance using four perspectives:
- Financial
- Customer
- Internal business processes
- Learning and growth

It balances short-term financial results with long-term strategic objectives.

---

## 8. Six Sigma

**Six Sigma** is a performance improvement methodology focused on:
- Reducing defects
- Improving process quality
- Enhancing operational efficiency

It uses the **DMAIC** cycle:
- Define
- Measure
- Analyze
- Improve
- Control

---

## 9. Balanced Scorecard vs Six Sigma

- **Balanced Scorecard:** strategic alignment and performance balance
- **Six Sigma:** operational process improvement and defect reduction

Both approaches complement BPM but serve different purposes.

---

## 10. Role of BI in Reporting and BPM

Business Intelligence supports:
- Consistent KPI definitions
- Integrated reporting
- Advanced visualization
- Faster and better decision making

BI tools connect data warehouses with dashboards and BPM systems.

---

## 11. Key Takeaways

- Reports and dashboards translate data into insight
- Visualization improves understanding and pattern recognition
- BPM links strategy with execution
- Balanced Scorecard and Six Sigma address different performance needs
