# Chapter 2 – Justifying BI: Building the Business and Technical Case

This chapter explains **why Business Intelligence (BI) projects must be justified** and how to build
both a **business case** and a **technical case** to set realistic expectations, reduce risk,
and guide successful BI implementation.

---

## 1. Why BI Justification Is Needed

Even when executives agree that BI is important, skipping justification is risky.

Key reasons for BI justification:
- Prevent BI projects from being labeled as failures
- Address **expectation gaps**, not technology issues
- Control scope, cost, and schedule
- Establish realistic ROI
- Identify risks and organizational readiness

Most BI project failures result from **unrealistic expectations**, not poor technology.

---

## 2. Building the Business Case

The business case explains **why BI is needed from a business perspective**.

It must answer:
- What business problems or opportunities are addressed?
- Who will use the BI solution?
- What business benefits are expected?
- Were there previous BI failures, and why?

Skipping the business case often leads to:
- Overly large and long projects
- Missed expectations
- Spreadmarts and data shadow systems
- Low business adoption

---

## 3. Defining the Business Case

To define a strong business case, the BI team must:
- Review business initiatives and priorities
- Identify business processes affected by BI
- Enlist business sponsors
- Engage business stakeholders
- Document business benefits

The focus should always be on **business problems**, not BI tools or technologies.

---

## 4. Review Business Initiatives and Processes

### 4.1 Business Initiatives
- Strategic initiatives are typically planned years ahead
- Almost all initiatives require data and analytics
- BI should directly support these initiatives

### 4.2 Business Processes
- Many processes are limited by analytical bottlenecks
- These bottlenecks may not be obvious to the business
- Identifying them strengthens the BI business case

Business initiatives and processes should be prioritized to avoid overwhelming BI demand.

---

## 5. Solicit BI Sponsorship

A BI project requires **at least one committed business sponsor**.

A good sponsor:
- Has budget authority or strong influence
- Secures business resources and commitment
- Is politically astute, enthusiastic, and realistic

Relying only on the CIO as a sponsor is risky because it:
- Makes BI appear IT-driven
- Reduces business ownership
- Leads to uncontrolled scope

The ideal scenario is one primary sponsor with a few secondary sponsors.

---

## 6. Enlist BI Stakeholders

Stakeholders include:
- BI end users
- People affected by BI outputs
- Data governance participants

Common mistake:
- Relying only on **power users**

Problems with power users:
- Filtered or biased requirements
- Not representative of all users
- May resist BI to protect existing spreadmarts

Early stakeholder involvement:
- Improves requirements quality
- Identifies gaps and risks
- Builds future BI adoption

---

## 7. Identify Business Processes Affected by BI

Business processes:
- Generate data
- Produce KPIs and business measures
- Are central to BI deliverables

Organizing BI around processes:
- Clarifies BI usage
- Strengthens business cases
- Improves stakeholder engagement
- Makes benefits easier to identify

---

## 8. Document Business Benefits

Failing to document benefits leads to:
- Overblown expectations
- Underfunded BI teams
- Continued use of shadow systems
- BI viewed as overhead instead of enabler

### 8.1 Tangible vs Intangible Benefits

- **Intangible benefits** (e.g., “better decisions”) are subjective
- BI justification should focus on **tangible, measurable benefits**

Tangible benefits often align with:
- Existing business initiatives
- Improved business processes
- Cost reduction, revenue growth, efficiency gains

---

## 9. Building the Technical Case

The technical case explains **how BI will be implemented**.

It involves:
- Selecting BI, data integration, database, and infrastructure technologies
- Narrowing options to short lists
- Estimating costs and feasibility

Technology selection should involve:
- Business users
- Technologists
- Architects and power users (but not exclusively)

---

## 10. Technology and Product Short Lists

Best practices include:
- Conducting evaluations and proofs of concept
- Establishing success and value criteria
- Scoring and ranking products
- Considering total cost and affordability

Evaluations can be:
- Detailed (during justification phase)
- Abbreviated (high-level estimates first)

---

## 11. Convincing Business People

Business users may prefer:
- Expanding operational reporting
- Spreadsheets and data shadow systems
- Doing nothing (“good enough” alternatives)

The BI team must justify BI by:
- Comparing BI against these alternatives
- Emphasizing long-term value, scalability, and agility
- Prioritizing **business value over feature count**

A BI tool is not “best” if business users will not use it.

---

## 12. Convincing Technologists

Technologists may resist BI due to:
- Fear of losing expertise
- Learning new tools and architectures

Success requires:
- Involving technologists early
- Showing career and skill growth benefits
- Strong sponsorship to secure time and commitment

---

## 13. Key Takeaways

- BI justification sets expectations and reduces failure risk
- Business case focuses on **why BI is needed**
- Technical case focuses on **how BI will be delivered**
- Tangible benefits and stakeholder buy-in are critical
- Adoption matters more than tool sophistication
